# HTML Usage Guide

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It consists of a series of elements, each enclosed in angle brackets, which define the structure and content of a web page. This guide provides an overview of common HTML elements and their usage.

## Basic Structure

HTML documents follow a basic structure consisting of an opening and closing `<html>` tag, with `<head>` and `<body>` sections enclosed within it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document -->
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- The "head" element contains meta information about the HTML page -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- The "meta charset" tag defines the character (Ã±) set used in the document -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- The "meta viewport" tag provides rendering instructions for browsers -->
    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- The "title" tag defines the title of the page that appears in the browser's tab -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- The "body" element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. -->
  </body>
</html>

```
